# Refund and Cancellation Policy

Version: `1.0`  
Effective date: `[YYYY-MM-DD]`  
Payment processor: `LemonSqueezy`

## 1. Scope

This policy governs cancellation and refund handling for OptivexIQ paid plans, including recurring subscriptions and one-time purchases.

## 2. Subscription Cancellation

- Customers may cancel recurring plans at any time from the billing settings or by contacting support.
- Cancellation prevents future renewals.
- Access remains active until the end of the current paid billing period unless account is suspended for cause.
- No partial prorated refund is provided for the unused portion of an active billing cycle unless required by applicable law.

## 3. One-Time Purchase Terms

- One-time plans are billed once and do not auto-renew.
- Entitlement scope is defined at purchase.
- Refund requests for one-time purchases are evaluated under Sections 5 and 6 below.

## 4. EU 14-Day Withdrawal Right

Where EU consumer withdrawal rights apply, customers may have a 14-day withdrawal period for distance contracts.  
For digital services, this right can be lost once performance has begun after explicit prior consent and acknowledgment.

Operational handling:

- At checkout, customer consent and acknowledgment language must be shown where required.
- If service delivery has not started, eligible withdrawal requests within 14 days are honored.
- If digital service delivery has started with valid consent/acknowledgment, withdrawal may be excluded to the extent allowed by law.

## 5. Refund Eligibility

Refunds may be granted where:

- duplicate charge occurred,
- technical failure prevented meaningful service access after reasonable remediation,
- charge resulted from verified billing error,
- mandatory law requires refund.

Refunds are generally not granted solely because:

- customer did not achieve expected business results,
- customer changed strategy after delivery,
- customer forgot to cancel before renewal.

## 6. “No Results” Dissatisfaction Handling

For dissatisfaction with AI output quality or commercial outcomes:

- support triages case with product and data context,
- remediation may include rerun guidance, output review, or account assistance,
- refund is not automatic and is evaluated against documented service performance and legal obligations.

## 7. Chargebacks and Disputes

- Customers should contact support before opening a chargeback.
- We provide supporting evidence to processor/banks for disputed transactions.
- Repeated abusive chargebacks may result in account restriction or termination.

## 8. Fraud and Abuse Handling

- Suspicious transactions may be blocked, reversed, or escalated.
- We may request verification before granting refunds in high-risk scenarios.
- Fraud-related decisions are documented for audit.

## 9. Request Channels and Processing Timelines

- Refund/cancellation requests: `[billing@yourdomain.com]` or `/contact`.
- Initial response target: within 2 business days.
- Final decision target: within 10 business days.
- Approved refunds are processed via LemonSqueezy according to card network and bank processing timelines.

## 10. Policy Alignment with Billing Provider

- Payment processing, tax handling, and transaction records are managed via LemonSqueezy.
- Where this policy conflicts with mandatory law, mandatory law prevails.
- Where processor constraints apply, we implement nearest lawful operational equivalent.
